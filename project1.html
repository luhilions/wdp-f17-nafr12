<h1> Hello World!
  <h2> A Plave I Would Like To Visit.</h2>
    <p> I would like to visit Japan. Japan is a plave with a multitude of technological advances that i want to learn about.
      ItÂ´s also considered to be a place of peace and relaxation. Which I think I would enjoy. Overall I think Japan would be both fun
      and interesting. Which is reason enough for me to visit.</p>
  <h2> A Person I Admire.</h2>
  <p> A person I admire is still alive. His name is Mark Fischbach. He is a youtuber who donates thousands of dollars to charities every
    year. And he makes this money by playing video games! So watching him do what he loves and having fun, all while he is donating a lot of his
    money to people who need it, is both encouraging and admirable to me.</p>
  <h2> Favorite Fruits </h2>
  <ul><li>Apples</li>
    <li>Bannanas</li>
    <li>Grapes</li>
    <li>Pears</li>
    <li>Peaches</li></ul>
  <h2> Favorite Presidents</h2>
  <ol><li>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</li>
    <li>Theodore Roosevelt</li>
    <li>Ronald Reagan</li>
    <li>George Washington</li>
    <li>Abraham Lincoln</li></ol>
